## About Pastebin

It's a Pastebin. Carefully hand-crafted using Laravel and Tailwind CSS and is 100% Javascript free. Uncontrolled low-key pandemics produce eccentricities. This is one of them. I am one of them. My goal is to develop an attractive, minimalist yet, somehow, the most over-engineered Pastebin ever.

## Deployment

### Server requirements

Anything north of an Arduino should do.

### Deployment checklist.
